## WIP

Please wait…

### To do

* [ ] Use [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) in packaging task to suffix packe's name with `package.json`'s version;
* [ ] Any kind of interest in a `@font-face` and icon fonts generation task?
* [ ] Use [gulp-inject-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-inject-svg) when `<img>` is sourcing an SVG file;
* [ ] Try [gulp-svg-store](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-svgstore) or [gulp-svg-sprite](https://github.com/jkphl/gulp-svg-sprite) to combine SVG into a single sprite using `<symbol>`;
* [ ] Use something like [gulp-uncss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uncss) to remove unused CSS, based on a a list of HTML pages ;
* [ ] Add [gulp-louis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-louis) for performance budget, or as a simple performance testing tool ;
* [ ] Add a style guide generator? Or would a dedicated HTML page *and*  well modularized CSS components ben enough?
